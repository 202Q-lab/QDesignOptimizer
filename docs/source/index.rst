==================================================
Welcome to the qdesignoptimizer's documentation!
==================================================

| The quantum design optimization package ``qdesignoptimizer`` is an open-source library developed by researchers of the `202Q-lab <https://202q-lab.se/>`_ at Chalmers, Gothenburg, Sweden. Further information on the development, references, and events can be found on `202Q-lab research page <https://202q-lab.se/q-design-optimizer/>`_. 
| To get started, please check the :ref:`userguide`.
